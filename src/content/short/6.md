This mapped type is a 'noop type' in the sense that `input type === output type`. Still, but comes in handy with **intersection/composed types** when editing code as it flattens the given input type. As an example,

```typescript
type Ugly = {id: string;} & {date: Date;}
// becomes
type Pretty = {id: string; date: Date;}
// with
type Flatten<T> = {
    [K in keyof T]: T[K];
} & {};
```
