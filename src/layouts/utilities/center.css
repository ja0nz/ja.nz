CENTER UTILITY
https://every-layout.dev/layouts/center/

Whenever you wish something to be horizontally centered,
 the Center is your friend.

Args
 * max-inline-size: --center--measure, 60ch
 - In a context narrower than --center--measure,
   the contents will currently be flush with either side of the
   parent element or viewport.
 - In general, if you want an 80-character column width and youâ€™re going to use ch to size it,
   aim for about 60ch
